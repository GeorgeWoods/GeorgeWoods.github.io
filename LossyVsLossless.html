<h3>Lossy:</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lossy is a form of compression where once the compression has been completed you will lose some of the original data
    from the file. You would use lossy compression when the user will be almost unable to notice the missing data from
    the file. For example lossy compression is used a lot in images with jpeg, this is because most of the time the
    user is unable to notice the missing data from the file.</p>

<h3>Lossless:</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lossless compression is a form of compression where you will not lose any of the original data and the file will be
    fully restorable to it's original form. Lossless compression is often used with photo editors are they will want
    the highest amount of quality on their image that they are editing. One exapmple of lossless compression used in
    images a lot is a png file. A png file will give a much higher quality image compared to a jpeg which is why photo
    editors like to use it.</p>
